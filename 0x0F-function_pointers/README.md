# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Scripts

| Script                  | Description                                                                                                                          |

| 0-object_like_macro.h   | Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024                                           |
| 1-pi.h                  | header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359                                             |
| 2-main.c                | program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. - You are allowed to use the standard library |
| 3-function_like_macro.h | Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.                                                   |
| 4-sum.h                 | Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y                                                   |
